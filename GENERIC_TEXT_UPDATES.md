# 📝 Generic Text Updates - COMPLETED!

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

You were absolutely right! The app had specific "pilot" references that were too narrow for a general health and wellness application. I've updated the text to be more inclusive and generic.

## 🔧 **Text Changes Made**

### **📧 Email Input Field**
**Before**: ❌ `pilot@example.com` (too specific for aviation)
**After**: ✅ `your.email@example.com` (generic and inclusive)

**Location**: `email_form.dart` - Email input field placeholder
**Impact**: Makes the email form welcoming to all users, not just pilots

### **👤 Profile Page Default Name**
**Before**: ❌ `'Pilot'` (assumes user profession)
**After**: ✅ `'User'` (generic and inclusive)

**Location**: `profile_page.dart` - Default display name
**Impact**: Neutral default name that works for any user

### **🏠 Home Page Default Name**
**Before**: ❌ `'Pilot'` (assumes user profession)
**After**: ✅ `'User'` (generic and inclusive)

**Location**: `home_page.dart` - Default display name
**Impact**: Welcoming greeting for all users regardless of profession

## 🎯 **What Stayed the Same**

### **✈️ Flight/Roster Related Content**
**Kept**: All pilot-specific references in flight and roster features
**Reason**: These are legitimate aviation features for pilot users
**Examples**:
- `Long Haul Pilot` / `Short Haul Pilot` profession options
- `Captain Sarah Johnson` in mock flight data
- `pilotName` in flight schedule models

## 📱 **User Experience Improvements**

### **More Inclusive Language**
- ✅ **Email placeholder**: Generic format that anyone can relate to
- ✅ **Default names**: "User" instead of profession-specific terms
- ✅ **Broader appeal**: App feels welcoming to all health-conscious users
- ✅ **Professional neutrality**: No assumptions about user's job

### **Maintained Aviation Features**
- ✅ **Pilot-specific features**: Still available for aviation professionals
- ✅ **Profession selection**: Users can still choose pilot roles in onboarding
- ✅ **Flight tracking**: Aviation features remain intact for pilot users
- ✅ **Flexible design**: App works for both general users and pilots

## 🎨 **Design Philosophy**

### **Inclusive by Default**
- ✅ **Generic placeholders**: Don't assume user background
- ✅ **Neutral language**: Welcoming to all professions
- ✅ **Flexible branding**: Health app first, aviation features optional
- ✅ **Broad market appeal**: Attracts wider user base

### **Specialized When Needed**
- ✅ **Aviation features**: Available when users select pilot profession
- ✅ **Context-appropriate**: Pilot terms used only in flight-related features
- ✅ **User choice**: Let users define their profession during onboarding
- ✅ **Feature segregation**: General health vs. aviation-specific features

## 📱 **Result**

**The app now uses inclusive, generic language while maintaining aviation features!**

- ✅ **Email form**: Generic placeholder (`your.email@example.com`)
- ✅ **Profile defaults**: Neutral "User" instead of "Pilot"
- ✅ **Home page**: Welcoming to all users
- ✅ **Aviation features**: Still available for pilot users
- ✅ **Broader appeal**: Attracts health-conscious users from all professions

The app now feels welcoming to everyone while still providing specialized features for aviation professionals!
